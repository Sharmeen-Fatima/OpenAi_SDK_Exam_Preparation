#### 1. <code>Agent</code> 🤖

- Represents the LLM (Large Language Model) <code>agent.</code>😏
- You can give it instructions (for example, "act like a helpful assistant").✨
- This <code>agent</code> will later take input and send a query to the model. ⭐

---
#### 2. Runner

- Used to run the <code>agent.</code>
- It manages the interaction between the <code>agent</code> and the model.
- Here, <code>Runner.run_sync(...)</code> is used — which means it is running in <code>**synchronous (non-async)**</code> mode.

---
#### 3. <code>OpenAIChatCompletionsModel</code>
- This class defines a model that follows the <code>**OpenAI-style chat completion API**</code>.
- In this example, <code>**Gemini**</code> has also been wrapped to behave like this API.
