## **LLM {Large Language Model} ⭐**
---
### Q1: What is Agent? 🔥
**A1** An agent is a smart software program that can take input, understand it, and perform tasks or give responses automatically.. 😊

---
### Q2: Is the agent have brain? 💡
**A2** The LLM is like the brain that understands and generates language. An agent uses that brain to take actions, connect with tools, and complete tasks. So the agent is not the brain itself — it’s more like the decision-maker that uses the brain to get things done.. 🎯
<p><b>Short Answer</b></p>

**A2** The LLM is the brain, and the agent is the one using that brain to act and get things done.. 🎯

### Q3: What is Runner?💎
**A3** As the name suggests, a **Runner** is something that runs or executes a task. In the Agentic AI SDK, the **Runner** is responsible for running the **Agent**, meaning it helps the Agent operate and perform its tasks. 📚

---
### Q4: <code>Run_Config</code> in OPENAI SDK. 📕
**A4** When using the OpenAI SDK’s Assistant API (especially with tool calling or function calling), the run_config parameter is used to define additional options or settings, such as: 📖
- Enabling or disabling streaming ✨
- Specifying the tool choice ✒
- Setting the temperature 🔥
- Defining the maximum number of tokens ✍🏻
- Choosing the response format 👍
- Controlling function calling behavior 🔐

---
### Q5: Why we use <code>Run_Config?</code> 🙄
**A5** ✔️ To customize the behavior of the Assistant. For example, you can:
- Stream the output in real-time 🎯
- Use a specific tool ⭐
- Control the temperature (creativity level) 💡
- Set a token limit 😊
- Define a function call strategy (auto, none, or a specific function) 💎

---
### Q6: 🛠️ When <code>run_config</code> Is Not Used...
**A6** If you don’t specify a <code>run_config,</code> the OpenAI SDK will use default values. However, this may lead to deterministic outputs or incorrect tool selection — which is why providing a run_config is considered a best practice. ✅
