### Q1 What is Agent?
**A1** An agent is a smart software program that can take input, understand it, and perform tasks or give responses automatically.
### Q2 Is the LLM brain if Agent?
**A2** The LLM is like the brain that understands and generates language. An agent uses that brain to take actions, connect with tools, and complete tasks. So the agent is        not the brain itself — it’s more like the decision-maker that uses the brain to get things done.
